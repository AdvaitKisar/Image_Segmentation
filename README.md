# Image Segmentation with U-Net

## Overview
This project implements an image segmentation model using the U-Net architecture, which is particularly effective for biomedical image segmentation tasks. The model is designed to accurately classify each pixel in an image, distinguishing between different objects or regions.

## Introduction
Image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision that involves partitioning an image into multiple segments to simplify its representation and analyze it effectively. This project is based on concepts learned from a Coursera course on deep learning and image processing.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdvaitKisar/Image_Segmentation.git
   cd Image_Segmentation
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Image_segmentation_Unet.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess your dataset, train the model, and visualize the results.

## Model Architecture
The U-Net architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. Key components include:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- Max pooling layers for downsampling.
- Up-convolutional layers for upsampling.
- Skip connections to retain spatial information.

## Results
The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and pixel accuracy. Visual results will be displayed in the notebook after training.
